## Create next.js app without creating and install the depedency you usually need

As I'm getting tired to create new project and must build my component from scratch and install the depedency I decided to skip this redundant step.

Inspired by create-next-app I modify the CLI tool to meet what I really need.

With technology addition including:
- [swr](https://swr.vercel.app)
- [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

The technology that I use will continue to increase.
